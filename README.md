# Pokemon Type Effectiveness Calculator
GUI made using Tkinter to help maximize type coverage when playing Pokemon
Currently only supports Gen 3

Click boxes to select the move you want to change, then select the move type from the list below.
Click the Calculate button below the Suggested Move Set to generate a move set that should have better type coverage. Sometimes you need to click twice, don't know why.
  - If the Suggested Move Set does not change after a few clicks, the program cannot think of a move set it recommends over your current selection.
